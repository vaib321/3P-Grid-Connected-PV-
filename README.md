ABSTRACT: In this paper, a two-stage grid connected photovoltaic system present which consists of inverter and dc-dc converter (Boost converter). We know that two stage means there are converter and inverter both in system. The paper suggests design and PV simulation in MATLAB for two stages system. The pulse width modulation (PWM) is applied on the inverter to synchronizing the current with the Grid voltage in the system. In two-stage, Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm is connected to the dc-to-dc converter which extracts high power from MPPT. This paper deals with simulation of two-stage grid connected photovoltaic system in MATLAB with the simulated results.
